    "Second assessed coursework for the course: Técnicas e Algoritmos em Ciência de Dados\n",
    "\n",
    "This coursework aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of linear regression with polynomial basis functions and classification with K-nearest neighbours. Specifically, students will learn about key concepts related to the model's generalisation ability by changing the degree of the polynomial and the size of the dataset. In the second part of the coursework, students will delve into classification using the K-nearest neighbours algorithm. Finally, students will be introduced to the concept of using a validation set to select the optimal value of $K$ for their classification model. By the end of this coursework, students will have gained a solid understanding of these key concepts and be equipped with the skills to apply them in practical scenarios.\n",
