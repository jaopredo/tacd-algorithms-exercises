    "### Decision_Trees\n",
    "## Part 1 - Decision Trees for Classification (value: 30%)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement a decision tree for classifying whether the income of a person exceeds $50k/yr based on census data (adult_census_subset.csv in ECLASS). You will use the Information Gain based on the Gini Index as the impurity measure as the splitting criterion. The maximum depth and the minimum number of instances per leaf will be your stopping criteria. Be aware that some of the variables in this dataset are nominal (or categorical).\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this exercise, you will write code to build a decision tree for this problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dataset Splitting:\n",
    "    - Load the provided dataset into your code.\n",
    "\t- Split the dataset into three sets: training, validation, and testing, with a 70/15/15 ratio, respectively. \n",
    "2. Implement a function to learn Decision Trees – the main conceptual steps are detailed below:\n",
    "\t- Initialize an empty decision tree.\n",
    "\t- Implement a recursive function to build the decision tree:\n",
    "        - The stopping conditions for the recursive function are [note: satisfying only one of them is sufficient to stop the recursion]:\n",
    "            - If the maximum depth is reached, stop growing the tree and create a leaf node with the frequency of the positive class for the remaining instances.\n",
    "            - If the number of instances at a leaf node is less than the minimum number of instances per leaf, create a leaf node with the frequency of the positive class for those instances.\n",
    "        - Your code will calculate the Information Gain (based on the Gini Index) for each possible value of each attribute and choose the attribute and value that maximizes the Information Gain (explanation below).\n",
    "        - Your code will create a new internal node using the chosen attribute and value.\n",
    "        - Your code will recursively call the build function on each subset of instances created by the split.\n",
    "3. Implement a classification function. Implement a function to classify new instances using the decision tree:\n",
    "\t- For each instance, traverse the decision tree by comparing its attribute values to the decision nodes and move down the tree based on the attribute values until a leaf node is reached.\n",
    "\t- Return the frequency of the positive class that is associated with the leaf node as the prediction for the instance.\n",
    "4. Run your algorithm and evaluate its performance:\n",
    "\t- Call the build function with the training set to construct the decision tree. You will vary the maximum depth and minimum number of instances per leaf to observe their effects on the decision tree performance. You will use the training set to learn the tree and the validation set using the Area Under the Roc Curve (AUROC) to find the optimal parameters. Try only shallow trees of a depth not deeper than 10, and min_instances not smaller than 10. If you try more extreme values, the training time could be too much.\n",
    "\t- Build a decision tree using the training + validation sets with the best combination of parameters.\n",
    "\t- Calculate the accuracy (threshold: 0.5) and AUROC of the decision tree in the testing set and report them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select the best split at each node you will use the Information Gain based on the Gini Index. The Gini Index measures the impurity of a node in a decision tree. To calculate the Information Gain based on the Gini Index, follow these steps [note: the same is explained in the slides for the case of entropy]:\n",
    "- For each potential split (feature and value):\n",
    "\t- Calculate the Gini Index for node m (before any splits) using the class distribution within the node, using the following formula:\n",
    "        - $G_m=\\sum_{k=1}^K (\\hat{p}_{mk} (1-\\hat{p}_{mk})$, where $\\hat{p}_{mk}$ represents the proportion of instances in the node $m$ that belong to class $k$.\n",
    "\t- Calculate the Gini Index for each possible outcome. This involves the following steps:\n",
    "        - Split the data based on the attribute's possible outcomes.\n",
    "        - Calculate the Gini index for each resulting subset using the same formula as in step a.\n",
    "\t- Calculate the weighted Gini index by summing up the Gini indexes of each subset, weighted by the proportion of instances it represents in the original node. The formula for the weighted Gini index ($W$) is as follows:\n",
    "        - $W_V=\\sum_v^V \\frac{|S_v|}{|S|} G_{S_v} $ where $S_v$ is the node after the split and the sum iterates over all the children nodes; $|S_v|$ represents the cardinality of the node and $|S|$ the cardinality of the node before splitting; $G_{S_v}$ represents the Gini index of the node.\n",
    "\t- Calculate the information gain by subtracting the weighted Gini index obtained in step c. from the Gini index of the current node. The formula is as follows:\n",
    "        - $InformationGain=G_{node}-W_V$\n"

You will vary the different parameters of the Random Forest to observe their effect on the performance on the validation set. You will use the training set to learn the tree and the validation set using the Area Under the Roc Curve (AUROC) to find the optimal parameters. Again, keep your trees shallow and don’t build many decision trees, as this could delay the training time quite a lot.\n",
